By default, Mongo servers can be accessed with no authentication required. Many unexperienced users never enable authentication, which leands to certain Mongo servers being exposed to bad actors. In the example below, we highlight how easy it is to discover and access Mongo databases using openly available software:
- nmap or zmap for open port discovery
- Python via pymongo for access

## Open Ports Discovery

Consodering that:

1. The default MongoDB port is publicly available (`27017`) and can be used by anyone to attempt to attempt to identify servers running a Mongo instance.

2. Discovering open Mongo ports can be achieved by using at least three openly available software: shodan, nmap or zmap. Since shodan offers limited free access, we used nmap and zmap for the purpose of this report. 

All an attacker needs to do in order to discover open MongoDB ports is to use one of the following options:

### nmap
The nmap command used to discover open is:

```bash
nmap <IP_RANGE> -p 27017 -Pn > nmap.txt
```

This command probes open 27017 ports in the specified range (i.e. X.X.0.0/16) and outputs the result un the `nmap.txt` file. The output strcture is:

```bash
Nmap scan report for <IP_ADDRESS>
Host is up.

PORT      STATE  SERVICE
27017/tcp open mongod
```

To perform the attack, one has to manually add `<IP_ADDRESS>` to a new file (stripped from any other input).

### zmap
The zmap command used to discover open is:
